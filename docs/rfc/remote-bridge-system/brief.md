# RFC Brief: Local Software Web API Bridge

## Problem Statement

We need to build an always-on bridge system that exposes web-accessible APIs for local software that lacks native web integration (e.g., medical imaging systems, laboratory equipment, industrial control systems). The system must support:

- Out-of-process plugin architecture for integrating with diverse local software
- Web interface for local configuration and monitoring
- Secure cloud connectivity for API access
- User-initiated secure onboarding to organizational infrastructure

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **API Gateway**: Expose REST/GraphQL APIs for local software operations
- **Data Capture**: Retrieve data from local systems (e.g., capture X-rays, read sensor data)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible integration with various local software via out-of-process plugins
- **Web Interface**: Local UI for bridge configuration and status monitoring
- **Secure Onboarding**: User-initiated authorization to connect to organization's cloud
- **Always-On Operation**: Reliable background service for API availability

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, API authentication, local software isolation
- **Reliability**: Handle intermittent connectivity, queue operations if offline
- **Performance**: Low latency for local operations, efficient data transfer
- **Compatibility**: Work with legacy software that only exposes COM, CLI, or file-based interfaces
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows (primary), with Linux/macOS where applicable

## Business Context

Many specialized software applications (medical imaging, lab equipment, industrial systems) lack modern web APIs. This bridge enables cloud applications to interact with these local systems securely, enabling use cases like:
- Capturing X-rays from imaging software for cloud-based diagnosis platforms
- Reading data from laboratory instruments for LIMS integration
- Controlling local manufacturing equipment from cloud dashboards
- Integrating legacy desktop applications into modern web workflows

## Success Criteria

- Secure, authenticated connection to organizational infrastructure
- Plugin isolation preventing system compromise
- Local web interface for configuration and monitoring
- Reliable reconnection after network/system interruptions
- Simple user-initiated onboarding process

## Open Questions

1. What communication protocol for cloud connectivity? (WebSocket, gRPC, custom)
2. Plugin architecture: IPC mechanism? (Named pipes, TCP, shared memory)
3. Authentication: OAuth, certificate-based, or custom?
4. Update mechanism: Auto-update vs manual?
5. Local data storage requirements?
