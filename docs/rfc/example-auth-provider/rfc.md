# RFC: Authentication Provider

## Problem Statement

We need an authentication solution that supports Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and can integrate with our existing user database. The solution must handle 100K+ users within the first year with high reliability. Budget is a consideration but not the primary driver - system reliability and user experience are critical.

## Research Summary

The authentication landscape has shifted significantly toward cloud-hosted identity providers that handle the complexity of modern auth requirements (OAuth2, SAML, WebAuthn). Building authentication in-house is increasingly seen as a liability due to security risks and compliance requirements. Most successful platforms use either a major cloud provider's identity service or a specialized auth vendor.

Key findings:
- Industry standard is now delegated authentication rather than custom-built
- Vendor solutions dramatically reduce time-to-market and security risks
- Open source options exist but require significant operational expertise
- Pricing models vary widely based on active users vs total users

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Auth0 (by Okta)

**What it is:** Market-leading authentication-as-a-service platform with extensive features and integrations.

**Pros:**
- Best-in-class developer experience with SDKs for every platform
- Built-in MFA, SSO, social logins, passwordless
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Handles compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Advanced features like bot detection and breached password detection

**Cons:**
- Expensive at scale (~$2-3 per active user/month)
- Some vendor lock-in with custom rules/flows
- Okta acquisition has led to enterprise focus

**Best for:** Teams prioritizing developer experience and feature completeness over cost

### Approach 2: Azure AD B2C

**What it is:** Microsoft's cloud identity service for customer-facing applications.

**Pros:**
- Very cost-effective ($0.00325 per authentication)
- Deep Azure ecosystem integration
- Enterprise-grade reliability and compliance
- Custom policies for complex flows
- Built-in user migration tools

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve than Auth0
- UI customization is complex
- Documentation can be overwhelming
- .NET-centric (though supports others)

**Best for:** Organizations already on Azure wanting cost-effective scale

### Approach 3: Keycloak (Self-Hosted)

**What it is:** Open source identity management solution with enterprise features.

**Pros:**
- Free and open source (only pay for infrastructure)
- Full control over data and deployment
- Extensive protocol support (SAML, OAuth2, OpenID)
- No user limits or feature restrictions

**Cons:**
- Requires significant operational expertise
- Must handle security updates and scaling
- No built-in advanced threat protection
- Higher total cost of ownership when including operations

**Best for:** Teams with strong DevOps capabilities and data sovereignty requirements

## Comparison

| Factor               | Auth0       | Azure AD B2C | Keycloak         |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Setup Time           | Days        | Weeks        | Weeks            |
| Cost at 100K users   | ~$15K/month | ~$500/month  | ~$1K/month + ops |
| Developer Experience | Excellent   | Good         | Fair             |
| Operational Burden   | None        | Minimal      | High             |
| Feature Completeness | Excellent   | Very Good    | Good             |
| Vendor Lock-in       | Medium      | Medium       | None             |
| Compliance Support   | Built-in    | Built-in     | DIY              |

## Recommendation

**Recommended:** Azure AD B2C

Given the 100K+ user scale requirement and budget considerations, Azure AD B2C provides the best balance. It offers enterprise reliability at a fraction of Auth0's cost while avoiding the operational burden of Keycloak. The Azure ecosystem integration will benefit future microservices deployment.

**Alternative if:** Developer velocity is the top priority, choose Auth0. The superior developer experience and documentation will accelerate implementation despite higher costs.

**Avoid:** Self-hosted solutions (Keycloak, IdentityServer) unless you have dedicated security/operations staff. The hidden costs of maintaining auth infrastructure typically exceed vendor pricing.

## Key Decisions Needed

- [ ] Confirm budget flexibility - is $500/month acceptable vs $15K/month?
- [ ] Azure commitment - are we planning to use Azure for other services?
- [ ] Migration approach - big bang vs gradual migration from existing system?
- [ ] Compliance requirements - any specific certifications needed?
