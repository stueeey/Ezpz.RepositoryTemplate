# Exploration: Add API Rate Limiting

## Problem Restatement

You asked for rate limiting to prevent API abuse, specifically because some users are making 1000s of requests/minute
which degrades performance for everyone.

**Implicit requirements I'm inferring**:

- Need to identify and throttle abusive users without impacting legitimate ones
- Performance degradation suggests resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, or DB connections)
- The 1000s/minute pattern suggests automated/bot traffic
- Must maintain good user experience for the 99% of normal users
- Solution should scale as your API grows

**Key question**: Is the real problem the request volume itself, or the resource consumption those requests cause?

## Current System Analysis

Found in your codebase:

- ASP.NET Core 8 with attribute-based filters
- Redis already used for caching (StackExchange.Redis)
- Authentication via JWT tokens in `AuthorizationFilter`
- User objects contain: Id, Email, Role, SubscriptionTier
- Existing middleware pipeline well-established

## Architectural Approaches

### Approach 1: Traditional Rate Limiting (Request Counting)

**Paradigm**: Preventive request throttling

Implement sliding window counters in Redis to track and limit requests per user/IP. Return 429 when limits exceeded.

**Essential complexity**:

- Tracking request counts per identity
- Time window management
- Limit configuration

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Simple, well-understood pattern
- ✅ Clear feedback to clients
- ❌ Doesn't consider request cost/complexity
- ❌ May block legitimate burst traffic
- ❌ Requires tuning limits per endpoint

**Risk**: 🎯 Low | **Effort**: 💪 Easy

### Approach 2: Adaptive Load Shedding

**Paradigm**: Reactive system protection

Monitor system health metrics (CPU, memory, response times) and dynamically shed load when under stress, prioritizing by
user tier.

**Essential complexity**:

- Health metric collection
- Dynamic decision making
- Request prioritization

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Protects against actual resource exhaustion
- ✅ Self-tuning based on system capacity
- ✅ Handles varying request costs naturally
- ❌ Less predictable for clients
- ❌ More complex to implement and debug
- ❌ Requires careful metric selection

**Risk**: 🎯 Medium | **Effort**: 💪 High

### Approach 3: Cost-Based Quotas

**Paradigm**: Resource accounting

Assign computational "costs" to different operations. Users get a quota of points that regenerate over time. Complex
operations cost more points.

**Essential complexity**:

- Cost modeling for operations
- Quota tracking and regeneration
- Cost calculation framework

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Fair resource allocation
- ✅ Naturally handles expensive operations
- ✅ Flexible and business-aligned
- ❌ Requires analyzing and costing all operations
- ❌ More complex client integration
- ❌ Harder to explain to users

**Risk**: 🎯 Medium | **Effort**: 💪 High

### Approach 4: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Paradigm**: Fault isolation

Implement circuit breakers per user/tenant that trip when error rates exceed thresholds, providing automatic recovery.

**Essential complexity**:

- Failure detection
- Circuit state management
- Recovery mechanisms

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Protects against cascading failures
- ✅ Self-healing behavior
- ✅ Good for detecting abusive patterns
- ❌ Not primarily designed for rate limiting
- ❌ May be too coarse-grained
- ❌ Requires careful threshold tuning

**Risk**: 🎯 Low | **Effort**: 💪 Medium

## Analysis of Essential vs Accidental Complexity

**Essential for your problem**:

- Identifying users/requests to limit
- Tracking some form of usage
- Enforcement mechanism
- Fail-open behavior (your constraint)

**Potentially accidental**:

- Complex quota calculations
- Real-time metric aggregation
- Sophisticated prioritization algorithms
- Per-endpoint configuration (unless truly needed)

## Recommendation

**Recommended: Approach 1 (Traditional Rate Limiting) with pragmatic enhancements**

Why:

1. **Solves the stated problem** - Will stop the 1000s/minute abuse
2. **Simple and predictable** - Easy to reason about and debug
3. **Industry standard** - Well-understood by developers and users
4. **Fits your patterns** - Natural extension of your attribute-based filters
5. **Pragmatic enhancements** - Start simple, add cost-awareness only where needed

The other approaches add complexity that may not be justified by your current problem. If you're seeing resource
exhaustion from expensive operations (not just volume), we could layer in selective cost-based limits later.

## Confidence Level

**High** - This is a well-solved problem space. The traditional approach with your Redis infrastructure will handle your
immediate needs effectively. The architecture allows evolution toward more sophisticated approaches if needed.

## Questions for You

1. Are the 1000s/minute requests all hitting the same endpoints, or spread across your API?
2. Do you have specific endpoints that are particularly expensive (e.g., report generation, bulk operations)?
3. Would you prefer user-friendly degradation (e.g., queuing) or hard limits with clear 429 responses?
