# URL Shortener Service Brief

## Problem Statement
We need a service that allows users to create shortened URLs that redirect to longer URLs. This is useful for sharing links in space-constrained environments (social media, SMS) and for tracking link usage.

## Context
- Users need to share long URLs in environments with character limits
- Marketing teams want to track click-through rates on shared links
- We want to provide branded short URLs using our domain

## Success Criteria
- Users can submit a long URL and receive a short URL
- Short URLs redirect to the original URL
- System tracks basic usage metrics (click count)
- Short URLs are unique and collision-free
- Service handles high concurrent load

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing platform architecture
- Follow repository patterns for new services
- Use existing authentication/authorization patterns
- Must be horizontally scalable

## Out of Scope
- Custom short URL aliases (auto-generated only for v1)
- URL preview/safety checking
- Detailed analytics beyond click count
- QR code generation

## Risks
- Potential for abuse (malicious URL shortening)
- Storage growth over time
- Need for URL validation
- Handling expired/deleted URLs gracefully
